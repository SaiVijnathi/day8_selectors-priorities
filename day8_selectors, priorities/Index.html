    <h1>The Seven Wonders of the World</h1>
    <p id="intro">
      The Seven Wonders of the World are a collection of remarkable human-made
      structures that stand as a testament to the ingenuity, skill, and
      creativity of ancient civilizations. Originally listed by Greek
      historians, the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World include marvels like
      the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and the Statue
      of Zeus at Olympia. While many of these ancient wonders have been lost to
      time, modern initiatives have compiled new lists of wonders, including
      iconic structures such as the Taj Mahal, the Great Wall of China, and the
      Colosseum, celebrating humanity’s architectural achievements across the
      ages.

    <p class="picDesc">
      Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest
      building-construction projects, the Great Wall of China is widely thought
      to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed Chinese study,
      however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work began in the
      7th century BCE and continued for two millennia. Although called a “wall,”
      the structure actually features two parallel walls for lengthy stretches.
      In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. One not-so-great
      thing about the wall, however, was its effectiveness. Although it was
      built to prevent invasions and raids, the wall largely failed to provide
      actual security. Instead, scholars have noted that it served more as
      “political propaganda. The Great Wall of China is one of the most iconic
      structures in the world, symbolizing China's rich history and
      architectural prowess. Built over several dynasties, starting as early as
      the 7th century BC and continuing until the 17th century, the wall
      stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Initially, it was
      constructed to protect Chinese states from invasions by nomadic groups
      from the north, such as the Mongols. Its structure is composed of various
      materials, including stone, brick, tamped earth, and wood, depending on
      the region and resources available. The wall is not a continuous line but
      rather a series of walls and fortifications that snake through deserts,
      mountains, and plateaus. Some parts of the wall have deteriorated over
      time, but significant sections, particularly those near Beijing, have been
      restored. The Ming dynasty was responsible for building much of what we
      see today, with an emphasis on making it stronger and more imposing.
      Watchtowers were added to provide lookout points, and soldiers stationed
      along the wall could quickly relay signals to warn of approaching threats.
      Beyond its military function, the Great Wall holds cultural and symbolic
      significance. It represents China's resilience, unity, and determination
      to protect its civilization from outside forces. Today, it is a UNESCO
      World Heritage site and a major tourist attraction, drawing millions of
      visitors each year. Despite natural erosion and human damage, the Great
      Wall remains a testament to ancient engineering and a powerful reminder of
      China's historical endurance. In addition to its military and strategic
      significance, the Great Wall of China has become a symbol of cultural
      identity and pride for the Chinese people. Over the centuries, it has been
      the subject of legends, stories, and poetry, often symbolizing the
      boundary between the civilized world and the unknown. The wall's
      construction required immense manpower, with historians estimating that
      hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of laborers, soldiers, and
      prisoners worked on its various sections. Many people lost their lives
      during its construction, leading to its nickname "the longest cemetery on
      Earth." The sacrifices made during its creation further enhance its
      historical and emotional significance. Modern conservation efforts have
      helped preserve the wall, though it faces challenges from natural erosion,
      tourism, and vandalism. Local communities and the Chinese government have
      taken steps to protect it, implementing policies to control tourism and
      encourage responsible preservation. Some sections have been repurposed for
      contemporary use, such as hosting marathons and other cultural events,
      showing how the wall continues to evolve in its role within Chinese
      society. Its importance has transcended its original purpose, serving as
      both a reminder of China's ancient history and a symbol of its resilience
      in the modern world.”

    <h2 id="pic2">Chichén Itzá</h2>
    <p class="picDesc">
      Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which
      flourished in the 9th and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe
      Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of important
      monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the stepped
      pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above
      the Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the
      structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar
      year. During the spring and autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun casts
      shadows on the pyramid that give the appearance of a serpent slithering
      down the north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head. Life there was
      not all work and science, however. Chichén Itzá is home to the largest
      tlachtli (a type of sporting field) in the Americas. On that field the
      residents played a ritual ball game popular throughout pre-Columbian
      Mesoamerica. Chichén Itzá is one of the most significant archaeological
      sites of the ancient Maya civilization, located in the Yucatán Peninsula
      of Mexico. As a major urban center, it flourished between the 9th and 12th
      centuries AD and became a focal point for trade, politics, and religious
      ceremonies. The site covers approximately five square kilometers and
      features various temples, pyramids, and plazas that reflect the
      architectural and cultural achievements of the Maya people. Among the most
      famous structures is the Pyramid of Kukulkán, also known as El Castillo,
      which dominates the site and exemplifies the precision and sophistication
      of Maya architecture. El Castillo is not only a testament to the Maya's
      architectural prowess but also their astronomical knowledge. The pyramid
      was built to align with the equinoxes, and during these events, the play
      of light and shadow creates the illusion of a serpent slithering down the
      staircase. This serpent represents Kukulkán, the feathered serpent god of
      the Maya. The structure has 91 steps on each of its four sides, and when
      combined with the platform at the top, totals 365 steps, symbolizing the
      days of the solar year. This reflects the Maya’s deep understanding of
      time, mathematics, and astronomy. Another important structure at Chichén
      Itzá is the Great Ball Court, the largest of its kind in Mesoamerica. This
      court was used for the ancient Mesoamerican ballgame, a ritualistic and
      symbolic game often associated with religious and political significance.
      The court features elaborate carvings that depict the ballgame, including
      scenes of players, captives, and ritual decapitation, which was believed
      to be an offering to the gods. The acoustics of the ball court are another
      fascinating feature; a whisper from one end can be heard clearly at the
      other, which may have been used to amplify speeches or ceremonial
      announcements. The Temple of the Warriors and the nearby Group of a
      Thousand Columns further demonstrate the grandeur of Chichén Itzá. The
      Temple of the Warriors is adorned with carvings of warriors and figures
      from Maya mythology, while the columns suggest that large gatherings or
      markets were held in these open spaces. The site's layout and architecture
      reflect a blend of Maya and Toltec influences, indicating that Chichén
      Itzá was a melting pot of cultures during its peak. This integration of
      artistic and architectural styles points to the city's importance as a
      regional power and a hub for cultural exchange. Today, Chichén Itzá is
      recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the New Seven
      Wonders of the World. It attracts millions of visitors annually, who come
      to marvel at the grandeur and mystery of this ancient city. While much of
      the site has been preserved, ongoing archaeological work continues to
      reveal more about the Maya civilization, their rituals, and their way of
      life. Chichén Itzá remains a symbol of the Maya's enduring legacy and
      their remarkable contributions to science, architecture, and culture.

    <h2 id="pic3">Petra</h2>
    <img src="./Images/petra.webp" />
    <p class="picDesc">
      The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, nestled
      among sandstone mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be one of the
      places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. Later the
      Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during this time it
      flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially for spices.
      Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, and tombs into
      the sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun. In addition,
      they constructed a water system that allowed for lush gardens and farming.
      At its height, Petra reportedly had a population of 30,000. The city began
      to decline, however, as trade routes shifted. A major earthquake in 363 CE
      caused more difficulty, and after another tremor hit in 551, Petra was
      gradually abandoned. Although rediscovered in 1912, it was largely ignored
      by archaeologists until the late 20th century, and many questions remain
      about the city. Petra, an ancient city carved into the rose-red cliffs of
      southern Jordan, is one of the most extraordinary archaeological sites in
      the world. Known as the "Lost City," Petra was the capital of the
      Nabataean Kingdom and thrived as a trading hub between 400 BC and AD 106.
      Hidden within a rugged valley, Petra remained unknown to the Western world
      until Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it in 1812. The
      city’s unique architecture, with its monumental rock-cut facades, tombs,
      and temples, was sculpted directly into the cliffs, giving Petra its
      striking and timeless appearance. One of the most iconic structures in
      Petra is Al-Khazneh, or "The Treasury," an intricately carved building
      that stands 40 meters tall. Originally a royal tomb, the façade of
      Al-Khazneh is a masterpiece of Hellenistic design, with Greco-Roman
      influences evident in its columns, pediments, and sculptures. Its grand
      size and craftsmanship showcase the Nabataeans’ exceptional skill in
      engineering and architecture. The Treasury is the first sight that greets
      visitors after walking through the Siq, a narrow gorge that serves as the
      dramatic entrance to Petra. The Siq itself, with its towering walls, adds
      to the mystique and grandeur of the site. Beyond the Treasury, Petra
      unfolds as a sprawling city filled with rock-cut structures, temples, and
      even a Roman-style theater that could hold up to 8,000 spectators. The
      Nabataeans, who were masterful water engineers, built an extensive system
      of dams, cisterns, and aqueducts to supply the city with fresh water,
      allowing it to thrive in the arid desert environment. This ingenious water
      management system supported not only the city's population but also its
      lush gardens and agriculture, further enhancing Petra’s role as a
      flourishing center of trade and culture in the ancient world. The
      Monastery (Ad Deir) is another monumental structure within Petra, similar
      in design to the Treasury but even larger. Its vast façade, standing 50
      meters wide and 45 meters tall, was likely used as a temple or a place of
      religious gatherings. To reach the Monastery, visitors must ascend over
      800 steps carved into the rock, leading them through breathtaking
      landscapes. The journey up to the Monastery, and the site itself, offers a
      profound sense of Petra’s scale and the effort it took to construct such
      an awe-inspiring city. Today, Petra is a UNESCO World Heritage site and
      one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, attracting visitors from around
      the globe. Archaeologists continue to excavate and study Petra, uncovering
      more about the Nabataeans’ advanced civilization and their influence on
      trade routes across the ancient Near East. As a symbol of ancient
      ingenuity and cultural achievement, Petra remains a powerful testament to
      the resilience and creativity of the people who built it over two
      millennia ago.

    <h2 id="pic4">Machu Picchu</h2>
    <p class="picDesc">
      This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram
      Bingham, who believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used
      during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Although that
      claim was later disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu has confounded
      scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins of the Sun,” women
      who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. Others think that it was
      likely a pilgrimage site, while some believe it was a royal retreat. (One
      thing it apparently should not be is the site of a beer commercial. In
      2000 a crane being used for such an ad fell and cracked a monument.) What
      is known is that Machu Picchu is one of the few major pre-Columbian ruins
      found nearly intact. Despite its relative isolation high in the Andes
      Mountains, it features agricultural terraces, plazas, residential areas,
      and temples. Machu Picchu, often referred to as the "Lost City of the
      Incas," is a breathtaking archaeological site located high in the Andes
      Mountains of Peru. Built in the 15th century during the reign of the Inca
      emperor Pachacuti, Machu Picchu is a stunning example of Inca engineering,
      architecture, and culture. Perched on a mountain ridge at about 2,430
      meters (7,970 feet) above sea level, it was likely used as a royal estate
      or a religious retreat. The site was abandoned in the 16th century, during
      the Spanish conquest, but it remained largely hidden from the outside
      world until its rediscovery by American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911.
      The architectural genius of the Inca is evident in Machu Picchu’s layout,
      which seamlessly blends with the surrounding landscape. The city is
      divided into two main areas: the agricultural sector and the urban sector.
      The agricultural terraces, carved into the steep mountainside, were used
      for growing crops and preventing soil erosion, showcasing the Inca’s
      advanced agricultural techniques. In the urban sector, buildings like the
      Temple of the Sun and the Intihuatana stone reflect the spiritual
      significance of Machu Picchu. The Intihuatana, a carved stone believed to
      function as an astronomical calendar, highlights the Incas' deep
      connection to their environment and their sophisticated understanding of
      celestial movements. One of the most remarkable features of Machu Picchu
      is its construction without the use of mortar. The Inca employed a
      technique known as "ashlar," where stones were precisely cut and fitted
      together so tightly that not even a blade of grass could fit between them.
      This method made the structures highly resilient to earthquakes, a crucial
      feature in a region prone to seismic activity. The engineering marvel of
      Machu Picchu is further demonstrated by its advanced drainage systems and
      water channels, which helped manage the heavy rainfall in the region and
      provided fresh water to its inhabitants. Machu Picchu’s location, shrouded
      by dense forests and mist, added to its mystical aura and may have
      contributed to its preservation, as it was never discovered by the Spanish
      conquistadors. The surrounding landscape, with its dramatic cliffs and
      lush vegetation, enhances the sense of isolation and tranquility that
      visitors often describe. Today, the site is not only a major tourist
      destination but also a UNESCO World Heritage site, recognized for both its
      cultural and natural significance. The preservation of Machu Picchu is of
      paramount importance, as the growing number of visitors poses challenges
      to the conservation of its fragile structures. As a symbol of Inca
      ingenuity and spiritual depth, Machu Picchu continues to inspire awe and
      curiosity. Ongoing archaeological research sheds light on the daily life,
      rituals, and innovations of the Inca civilization, while its panoramic
      views of the Andes and the Urubamba River valley draw travelers from
      around the world. Machu Picchu stands as a testament to the Inca Empire’s
      extraordinary achievements and its ability to harmonize human development
      with the natural environment.

    <h2 id="pic5">Christ the Redeemer</h2>
    <img src="./Images/statue-Christ-the-Redeemer.webp" />
    <p class="picDesc">
      Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount
      Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World War I,
      when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.” They proposed a
      statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos
      Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was completed
      five years later. The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters)
      tall—not including its base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and
      its outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 meters). It is the largest Art Deco
      sculpture in the world. Christ the Redeemer is made of reinforced concrete
      and is covered in approximately six million tiles. Somewhat
      disconcertingly, the statue has often been struck by lightning, and in
      2014 the tip of Jesus’s right thumb was damaged during a storm. Christ the
      Redeemer, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, stands tall atop
      the Corcovado Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This monumental statue
      of Jesus Christ, with outstretched arms, symbolizes peace and embrace,
      overlooking the vibrant city below. Measuring 98 feet tall (30 meters) and
      standing on a 26-foot (8-meter) pedestal, the statue has become an
      enduring symbol of Christianity and a global icon of Brazil. It was
      completed in 1931 after nine years of construction and remains one of the
      most visited tourist attractions in the world. The figure’s open arms
      reflect the welcoming nature of the Brazilian people and the belief in
      universal compassion and forgiveness. The idea for the statue dates back
      to the 1850s, but it wasn’t until the 1920s that the Catholic Church in
      Brazil and local citizens pushed for the construction of a religious
      monument. The statue was designed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva
      Costa, while the French sculptor Paul Landowski created its face and
      detailed features. The structure is made of reinforced concrete and
      covered with thousands of triangular soapstone tiles, chosen for their
      durability and resistance to harsh weather conditions. The project was a
      collaborative effort, involving engineers, sculptors, and craftsmen, and
      it stands as a testament to both Brazilian and international expertise.
      Christ the Redeemer’s location on Corcovado Mountain provides stunning
      panoramic views of Rio de Janeiro, including landmarks such as Sugarloaf
      Mountain, Copacabana Beach, and the Maracanã Stadium. The site itself is
      part of the Tijuca National Park, a lush rainforest that enhances the
      dramatic backdrop of the statue. Visitors can reach the summit via a steep
      train ride or by climbing hundreds of steps, making the journey to the
      statue almost a pilgrimage. Once at the top, the sense of scale and
      serenity that the statue imparts, combined with the breathtaking views of
      the city and coastline, creates a deeply spiritual and awe-inspiring
      experience for many. Throughout its history, Christ the Redeemer has
      become much more than just a religious symbol. It has played an important
      role in Brazilian culture and national identity, often serving as a focal
      point during major events such as World Youth Day, the FIFA World Cup, and
      the Olympic Games. The statue is also a symbol of hope and resilience; it
      was illuminated with the flags of nations during the COVID-19 pandemic,
      symbolizing solidarity and global unity in difficult times. Regular
      maintenance and restoration work, including a major renovation for its
      75th anniversary in 2006, have ensured that the statue remains in
      excellent condition for future generations. As a UNESCO World Heritage
      site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, Christ the Redeemer
      continues to draw millions of visitors each year. Its powerful message of
      peace, love, and acceptance transcends religious boundaries, making it a
      universal symbol of faith and humanity. The statue’s commanding presence,
      combined with its cultural and spiritual significance, has made Christ the
      Redeemer a timeless emblem of Rio de Janeiro and an enduring beacon of
      hope in a complex world.

    <h2 id="pic6">Colosseum</h2>
    <p class="picDesc">
      The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the
      Emperor Vespasian. A feat of engineering, the amphitheater measures 620 by
      513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system of vaults. It
      was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, who watched a variety of events.
      Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though men battling animals
      was also common. In addition, water was sometimes pumped into the
      Colosseum for mock naval engagements. However, the belief that Christians
      were martyred there—namely, by being thrown to lions—is debated. According
      to some estimates, about 500,000 people died in the Colosseum.
      Additionally, so many animals were captured and then killed there that
      certain species reportedly became extinct. The Colosseum, also known as
      the Flavian Amphitheater, is one of the most remarkable and enduring
      symbols of ancient Rome. Located in the heart of the city, this massive
      structure was completed in AD 80 under Emperor Titus, though its
      construction began during the reign of his father, Emperor Vespasian.
      Capable of holding up to 50,000 spectators, the Colosseum was primarily
      used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles, animal hunts, and mock
      naval battles. Its elliptical shape and innovative design, which includes
      a complex system of vaults and arches, made it an engineering marvel of
      its time and a template for modern stadiums. The Colosseum’s architecture
      reflects the ingenuity of Roman engineering. Its four-story exterior is
      constructed from travertine stone, and the façade is adorned with columns
      in the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian styles. The interior was just as
      impressive, featuring a retractable awning system known as the *velarium*,
      which provided shade for the audience. Beneath the arena floor lay a vast
      network of underground tunnels and chambers called the *hypogeum*, where
      gladiators and animals were kept before entering the arena. These chambers
      were connected by elevators and trapdoors, allowing dramatic entrances and
      exits during the events. Events held in the Colosseum were often grand
      spectacles, designed to entertain the Roman public and showcase the power
      of the empire. Gladiatorial combats were the most popular attraction,
      where trained fighters, often slaves or prisoners of war, battled each
      other or wild animals. Emperors used these games as a way to gain favor
      with the populace, and they could last for days during major festivals.
      The Colosseum also hosted *venationes*, or staged animal hunts, where
      exotic animals like lions, tigers, and elephants were pitted against each
      other or human hunters in staged battles. These events were meant to
      demonstrate Rome’s dominance over nature and its enemies. Despite its
      original purpose as a venue for violent entertainment, the Colosseum has
      come to symbolize both the grandeur and complexity of ancient Roman
      society. In later centuries, after the fall of the Roman Empire, the
      Colosseum fell into disrepair and was repurposed as a fortress, a quarry,
      and a Christian shrine. However, much of the structure still stands today,
      even after centuries of earthquakes, stone looting, and natural wear.
      Preservation efforts over the past centuries have helped protect the
      Colosseum, and it continues to be one of the most visited monuments in the
      world, drawing millions of tourists annually. Today, the Colosseum is a
      UNESCO World Heritage site and a powerful reminder of Rome’s ancient
      legacy. While its bloody past is acknowledged, it is also viewed as a
      testament to Roman architectural prowess and the empire’s influence on the
      world. The Colosseum stands as a symbol of the strength, ambition, and
      creativity of one of the greatest civilizations in history, while also
      reminding us of the complexity of human culture and the evolution of
      entertainment over the millennia.

      This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s
      most iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal
      architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to
      honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in 1631
      giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 years and 20,000
      workers to construct the complex, which includes an immense garden with a
      reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of white marble that features
      semiprecious stones in geometric and floral patterns. Its majestic central
      dome is surrounded by four smaller domes. According to some reports, Shah
      Jahān wished to have his own mausoleum made out of black marble. However,
      he was deposed by one of his sons before any work began. The Taj Mahal,
      one of the most iconic monuments in the world, is a symbol of eternal love
      and a masterpiece of Mughal architecture. Located in Agra, India, it was
      commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632 in memory of his beloved wife,
      Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. The mausoleum, completed in
      1648, stands as a testament to their love and the emperor's grief. Built
      primarily of white marble, the Taj Mahal combines elements of Islamic,
      Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian architectural styles. Its symmetrical
      design, intricate carvings, and stunning inlay work make it one of the
      finest examples of Mughal art. The central structure of the Taj Mahal is a
      massive marble dome that rises 73 meters (240 feet) above a square base.
      The dome is flanked by four smaller domes and surrounded by four slender
      minarets, which are slightly tilted outward to prevent collapse in case of
      an earthquake. Inside the main chamber lies the cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal,
      with Shah Jahan’s cenotaph placed beside hers after his death. However,
      their actual graves are in a lower chamber beneath the main structure. The
      entire mausoleum is adorned with delicate marble carvings and
      semi-precious stones inlaid to form intricate floral patterns and
      calligraphy, particularly Quranic verses. The Taj Mahal’s setting enhances
      its beauty, with the structure reflected in a long pool leading to the
      entrance, part of a larger, meticulously designed garden known as the
      *charbagh*. This Persian-style garden symbolizes paradise and is divided
      into four quadrants by water channels. The layout creates a sense of
      tranquility and symmetry, which is a hallmark of Mughal architecture. The
      use of white marble gives the Taj Mahal its distinctive luminosity, which
      changes color throughout the day, from a soft pinkish hue at dawn to a
      brilliant white in the midday sun and a golden glow by moonlight, adding
      to its ethereal quality. In addition to being a monument of love, the Taj
      Mahal reflects the grandeur and wealth of the Mughal Empire. It was
      constructed by a workforce of over 20,000 artisans and craftsmen,
      including architects, stonecutters, inlayers, and calligraphers from
      across the empire and beyond. Materials such as marble, jasper, turquoise,
      and jade were sourced from all over India and as far away as China, Sri
      Lanka, and Afghanistan. The precision of the craftsmanship and the scale
      of the project illustrate the empire’s artistic and cultural
      sophistication during its golden age. Today, the Taj Mahal is recognized
      as a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the
      World, attracting millions of visitors from around the globe. While its
      beauty and architectural significance continue to captivate people, it is
      also a symbol of India's rich history and cultural diversity. Efforts have
      been made to preserve the monument from environmental damage and
      pollution, ensuring that the Taj Mahal remains a beacon of love, artistry,
      and history for future generations. Its timeless beauty, combined with the
      poignant story behind its creation, ensures that the Taj Mahal will always
      stand as one of the world’s most cherished monuments.
